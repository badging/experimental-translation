# Applicants  Workflow process to apply for event Badge

## Applicants are to open a PR  [here](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

### Please See the Diversity and Inclusion [README](https://github.com/badging/diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/README.md#applying-for-badges) for more information about applying for an event badge.  

>### The Event process will be initialized in a tabular format; 

 Date        | Event                                      | Badge 
------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------

The table format will have;

 `Date of event`

 `Event (name)`

 `Event Badge`

### Obtaining Event badges is very important because it encourages Diversity & Inclusion by implementing the appropriate practices and guidelines.
